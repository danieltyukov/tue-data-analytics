    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems with air quality and air polluting industries draw a lot of attention and lead to political debates. \n",
    "The weather can also have a significant impact on air quality (Czarnecka & Nidzgorska-Lencewicz, 2011). \n",
    "Researchers have shown that weather data should be taken into account when measuring air pollution and estimating the effects of air pollution prevention strategies (Grell & Baklanov 2011). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Air quality** is measured by measuring the concentration of different pollutants, with ground-level ozone ($O_3$), particle pollution (or particulate matter like $PM2.5$ and $PM10$), carbon monoxide ($CO$), sulfur dioxide ($SO_2$), and nitrogen dioxide ($NO_2$) being the five major ones as reported by the [U.S Air Quality Index (AQI)](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).\n",
    "Low air quality has proven to pose a serious threat to health and the environment (Qin et al., 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weather** factors such as *sunshine*, *temperature*, *rain*, and *wind speed* can make pollutants undergo certain chemical reactions, speed up the reaction process, wash out dissolvable pollutants, or disperse pollutants in a given area. \n",
    "For example, ozon ($O_3$) forms when nitrogen oxides ($NO_x$) coming from different sources, like vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions, react with volatile organic compounds in the presence of heat and sunlight (NOAA's National Weather Service, 2017).\n",
    "There is also evidence that the increase of certain pollutants, such as $O_3$, together with high temperatures, results in an increase in mortality (NOAA's National Weather Service, 2017). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Origin of the Data\n",
    "For this assignment, we will use air quality data from the Dutch website [luchtmeetnet](https://www.luchtmeetnet.nl/), which is an initiative of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management, the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), GGD Amsterdam, EPA for the greater Rotterdam area (DCMR), EPA South Limburg (RUDZL), EPA Middle and Western Brabant (OMWB), and EPA Region Arnhem (ODRA).\n",
    "The [dataset](https://data.rivm.nl/data/luchtmeetnet) is hosted by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment—a.k.a. Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu (RIVM). \n",
    "The air quality dataset reports concentrations of various chemical compounds measured and recorded from 2012 until 2021 by 125 stations located all over the Netherlands. (The 2022 data is not included, as it is not yet validated at the time this assignment is published.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, to contrast the air quality data against weather factor behavior, we will also analyze [climatologic data](https://www.knmi.nl/nederland-nu/klimatologie/uurgegevens) collected by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute—a.k.a. Koninklijk Nederlands Meteorologisch Instituut (KNMI).\n",
    "The KNMI is the national weather service of the Netherlands.\n",
    "One of its main tasks consists of weather monitoring and forecasting. \n",
    "The original dataset reports weather information from 1951 until the present date.\n",
    "Since then, 50 stations have been set up to collect weather measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current air quality (blue dots) and weather stations (orange dots) are shown in Figure 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "![stations_map](files/stations_map.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "* Is there a relation between the concentration of air compounds and the day, week, or month of the year?\n",
    "* Is there a relation between the concentration of different air compounds?\n",
    "* Is there a relation between weather factors and the concentration of air compounds?\n",

    "To create your prediction model you need to split the data into consecutive training and test data. This means that the test data should be measured entirely **after** the training data, which resembles how the model would be used in practice to predict the future. You should use the daily averages of the data, so `df_data_daily`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, split the entire data frame into two data frames: assign the **training data** to the `df_train` data frame and the **test data** to the `df_test` data frame. For example, the training data could contain all data from 2018 and backwards, and the test data all data from 2019. Note that you do not have to use all of the data from the entire date range; however, both samples should be **sufficiently large**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. From these two data frames, extract the training and the test data of your independent and dependent variables, selecting only the relevant columns. The **data frames** for your **independent variables** must be stored in the variables `X_train` and `X_test`, while the **series** for your **dependent variable** must be stored in the variables `y_train` and `y_test`. (The capitalization of the `X` indicates that it is a matrix (2-dimensional), whereas the lowercase `y` indicates that it is a vector (1-dimensional).)\n",
