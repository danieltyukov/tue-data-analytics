Since there are often more than one correct way to solve a programming problem, we try to accept various correct anwers.

Moreover, plotting an ECDF remains a bit tricky: using the library function provides almost no advantage.\n",

    "We want to use _Pandas_ to extract this ballistic part of the trajectory. For that, we need a _very precise definition_. The precise definition of the _ballistic_ part of the mouse trajectory is as follows: we first find the index `i_max` for which the (approximate) _speed_ is maximal (if there are multiple such indices, we take the smallest). Then, we define the range of indices from `i_left` to `i_right` as the largest range of indices containing `i_max` such that the speed is _increasing_ from `i_left` to `i_max` and _decreasing_ from `i_max` to `i_right`. The _ballistic_ part of the mouse trajectory is defined as the mouse trajectory restricted to the range from `i_left` to `i_right`.\n",
